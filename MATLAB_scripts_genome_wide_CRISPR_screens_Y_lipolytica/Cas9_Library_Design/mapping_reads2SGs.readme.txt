input files:

1. SGs.csv: the file containing sgRNA sequences

2. Lib_*_*.fastq(e.g. Lib_01_CAAGGCGA.fastq): the fastq files containing reads

output files:
Lib_*_*.counts.csv(e.g. Lib_01_CAAGGCGA.counts.csv): the csv files containing the counts of sgRNAs

method:

1. remove sgRNAs appearing more than once in SGs.csv file

2. store all of the left sgRNA sequences in a hash table

3. for each read, get all the distinct 20-mers contained in it. Search these 20-mers in the hash table. For the 20-mers found in hash table, add 1 to the counts of corresponding sgRNAs (which means these sgRNAs appear in this read).
